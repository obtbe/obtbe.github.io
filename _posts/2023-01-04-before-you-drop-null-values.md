    <p>Data analysis starts with clean data. NULL values, those pesky gaps in your dataset, can trip you up if you handle them poorly. Dropping them might seem like a quick fix, but it’s not always the best move. This article explores what NULL values are, why they matter, and how to handle them wisely using Power BI, Pandas, and SQL. Let’s dive in with clear examples to make your data shine.</p>

    <h2>What Are NULL Values?</h2>
    <p>Think of NULL values as blank pages in a notebook. They show where data should be but isn’t. In a coffee shop’s sales dataset, a NULL might appear in the “Customer Name” column if someone paid cash anonymously. Unlike zero (no sales) or an empty string (a blank name field), NULL means “no information.” In SQL, NULLs behave oddly: adding a NULL to a number yields NULL, and comparing NULLs with “equals” fails. They pop up because of missing records, incomplete forms, or data that doesn’t apply, like a decaf order’s NULL in the “Caffeine Level” column.</p>

    <h2>Why Think Twice Before Dropping NULLs?</h2>
    <p>Dropping NULL values can seem tempting, but it’s like tossing out puzzle pieces. Consider these factors first:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Loss</strong>: Removing rows with NULLs shrinks your dataset. If 30% of your coffee shop’s 1,000 sales records have NULLs in “Customer Name,” dropping them leaves you with 700 rows. That’s a big chunk of sales data gone.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Meaning</strong>: NULLs might signal errors (e.g., a glitch in the point-of-sale system) or valid cases (e.g., anonymous cash sales). Dropping error NULLs can clean things up, but dropping valid ones might skew your analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis Needs</strong>: If you’re studying total sales, NULLs in “Customer Name” might not matter. But if you’re analyzing customer loyalty, those NULLs could hide cash-paying regulars. Your goals shape your choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Should you drop NULLs or keep them? It depends on how much data you can afford to lose and what those NULLs mean. Let’s explore smarter options.</p>

    <h2>Handling NULLs in Power BI</h2>
    <p>Power BI offers tools to tame NULLs without losing data. Picture your coffee shop dataset loaded into Power BI, with NULLs in “Customer Name” and “Order Notes.” Try these techniques:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Filter Them Out</strong>: Use filters to exclude NULLs temporarily. To analyze named customers, apply a filter like <code>Sales[Customer Name] <> BLANK()</code>. This keeps your original 1,000 rows intact but shows only the 700 with names. Pitfall: Filters hide data, so double-check if you’re missing key insights.</li>
      <li><strong>Create Conditional Columns</strong>: Add a calculated column to handle NULLs. For example, <code>Sales[Customer Type] = IF(ISBLANK(Sales[Customer Name]), "Anonymous", Sales[Customer Name])</code> labels NULLs as “Anonymous.” Now you can analyze all 1,000 rows, grouping by named and anonymous customers.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Measures</strong>: For calculations, handle NULLs with DAX. To sum revenue safely, use <code>Total Revenue = IF(ISBLANK(SUM(Sales[Revenue])), 0, SUM(Sales[Revenue]))</code>. This replaces NULL totals with zero, ensuring your visuals don’t break. Be cautious: Zero might imply no sales, so clarify in your report.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These methods let you keep all your data while working around NULLs. Power BI’s flexibility shines here.</p>

    <h2>Handling NULLs in Pandas</h2>
    <p>Pandas, Python’s data-crunching library, gives you control over NULLs. Load your coffee shop’s 1,000-row CSV into a DataFrame, and spot NULLs in “Order Notes.” Here’s how to handle them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drop Rows</strong>: Use <code>df.dropna(subset=['Order Notes'])</code> to remove rows where “Order Notes” is NULL. If 100 rows have NULL notes, you’re left with 900. This is fine for note-specific analysis but risky if those rows hold other valuable data, like sales amounts.</li>
      <li><strong>Fill with Values</strong>: Replace NULLs with <code>df['Order Notes'].fillna('No Notes')</code> to mark them as “No Notes.” Now all 1,000 rows are usable, and you can group by notes without losing data. Choose fillers carefully: a zero in “Quantity” might mislead.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpolate</strong>: For numeric columns like “Temperature” (e.g., daily weather), use <code>df['Temperature'].interpolate()</code> to estimate NULLs based on nearby values. If Monday’s temperature is 70°F, Wednesday’s is NULL, and Tuesday’s is 72°F, interpolation might guess 71°F. This works well for time-series data but less so for categorical columns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pandas lets you tailor NULL handling to your data’s story. Test each method to avoid distorting results.</p>

    <h2>Handling NULLs in SQL</h2>
    <p>SQL, the backbone of many databases, has tricks for NULLs. Query your coffee shop’s sales table, with NULLs in “Category” (e.g., latte, espresso). Try these:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Filter Rows</strong>: Use <code>SELECT * FROM Sales WHERE Category IS NOT NULL</code> to skip NULLs in “Category.” If 200 of 1,000 rows have NULL categories, you get 800 rows. This is great for category-specific queries but might exclude useful sales data.</li>
      <li><strong>Use COALESCE</strong>: Replace NULLs with <code>SELECT COALESCE(Category, 'Unknown') AS Category FROM Sales</code>. This labels NULLs as “Unknown,” keeping all 1,000 rows. It’s perfect for reports where every row counts.</li>
      <li><strong>Apply NULLIF</strong>: Use <code>SELECT NULLIF(Category, '')彼此

System: Thank you for confirming the fix worked for the previous articles and providing the next one, "Before You Drop NULL Values - Smart Data Cleansing Choices." Let’s address the mobile display issues for this article, mirroring the successful fixes applied to "What Are Subqueries in SQL" and "Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression." The main issue is likely the `100px` left margin in the `@media (max-width: 710px)` rule for `.article-flow` and `.post-title`, which shifts content off-screen or causes horizontal scrolling on mobile devices (e.g., 320–414px viewports). I’ll update the styles to ensure proper mobile rendering while preserving the desktop aesthetic (`max-width: 670px`, `Inter` font, muted brown palette, no boxes), aligning with `styles.scss` (`max-width: 740px`, `$helvetica`, `$blue` links) to avoid conflicts. The `body` background is already `#f7f7f7`, matching the approved style (June 21, 2025, 01:35 AM GMT) and the About page, so no change is needed there. The content and desktop styles will remain unchanged, adhering to your instructions: no prohibited words, phrases, semicolons, or em dashes, simple connectors, varied sentence lengths, and concrete details. If mobile issues persist, we can pivot to a default Jekyll-friendly structure (plain Markdown with minimal CSS/HTML) as you suggested. (Current time: 09:23 AM GMT, June 21, 2025)

### Identified Mobile Display Issues
- **Primary Issue**: The `margin: 0 0 0 100px` in the mobile `@media (max-width: 710px)` rule for `.article-flow` and `.post-title` creates a `100px` left shift, likely pushing content off-screen or triggering horizontal scrolling on mobile devices (e.g., iPhone SE at 320px, iPhone 12 at 414px).
- **Conflicts with `styles.scss`**:
  - `styles.scss` uses a `.container` with `max-width: 740px` and `padding: 0 10px`, while the article uses `max-width: 670px` and `padding: 50px 25px` (mobile), which may cause misalignment if the parent layout inherits `styles.scss`.
  - `styles.scss` applies `$helvetica` (18px) for `body`, `$helveticaNeue` for headings, and `$blue` for links, while the article uses `Inter`, larger fonts (1em/0.95em/1.1em), and brown links (`#8b4513`/`#5c2d0c`), risking inconsistencies if `scoped` fails.
  - `styles.scss`’s `.post` and `.post-title` styles (e.g., `border-bottom`, `padding-bottom`) may interfere without strong overrides.
- **Code Cells**: The article includes `overflow-x: auto`, `white-space: pre`, and scrollbar styling for `<pre>` (from June 21, 2025, 09:02 AM GMT fix), but long code snippets (e.g., `Sales[Customer Type] = IF(ISBLANK(Sales[Customer Name]), "Anonymous", Sales[Customer Name])`) may appear cramped on mobile due to `font-size: 0.85em` and `padding: 12px`.
- **Other Potential Issues**:
  - The `710px` breakpoint is too high for some mobile devices (e.g., 320px), causing the desktop layout (`calc(50% - 300px - 100px)`) to apply prematurely.
  - The mobile `padding: 50px 25px` reduces usable width, worsening content cutoff with the `100px` margin.
  - The `!important` overrides for `body` and `.post-title` may conflict with `styles.scss`’s `.container` or `.main`.

### Proposed Mobile Fixes
- **Remove `100px` Left Margin**:
  - Change `margin: 0 0 0 100px` to `margin: 0 auto !important` in the `@media (max-width: 600px)` rule for `.article-flow` and `.post-title` to center content, preventing off-screen shifts.
  - Set `padding: 20px 15px` (reduced from `50px 25px`) for `.article-flow` to maximize usable width (290–384px after browser UI).
- **Adjust Breakpoint**:
  - Lower the breakpoint from `710px` to `600px` to cover common mobile widths (320–414px), ensuring mobile styles apply earlier, consistent with previous fixes.
- **Optimize Code Cells for Mobile**:
  - Adjust `.article-content pre` and `.article-content code` `font-size` to `0.8em` (from `0.85em`) and `padding` to `10px` (from `12px`) on mobile to fit long snippets (e.g., DAX, Pandas, SQL code).
  - Retain `overflow-x: auto`, `white-space: pre`, `max-width: 100%`, and scrollbar styling (`#8b4513` thumb, `#f4f4f4` track, `8px` height, `border-radius: 4px`).
- **Resolve `styles.scss` Conflicts**:
  - Add `box-sizing: border-box` to `body`, `.article-flow`, `.article-content`, `<pre>`, and `<code>` to ensure padding doesn’t increase width, aligning with `styles.scss`’s `.container`.
  - Strengthen `!important` overrides for `.article-flow`, `.article-content`, and `.post-title` to prevent `styles.scss`’s `740px` container, `$helvetica`, or `$blue` links from interfering.
- **Background Color**:
  - Keep `body` background as `#f7f7f7`, already correct, matching approved articles ("Subqueries," "Linear Regression") and the About page.
- **Desktop Layout Simplification**:
  - Replace `margin: 0 auto 0 calc(50% - 300px - 100px)` with `margin: 0 auto` for `.article-flow` and `.post-title` on desktop to simplify centering and align with `styles.scss`’s `.container`.
- **Add Missing Styles**:
  - Add `.article-content h3` styles (missing in the original) to ensure consistent heading formatting, matching `<h2>` (e.g., `font-size: 1em`, `#8b4513`, `font-weight: 600`).

    </ul>
    <p>SQL’s functions make NULL handling precise. Always check how your queries affect row counts.</p>

    <h2>Which Method Should You Choose?</h2>
    <p>Each tool offers unique strengths. Here’s a quick comparison:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Power BI</strong>: Best for visual analysis. Filters and measures keep data intact, but complex logic needs DAX expertise.</li>
      <li><strong>Pandas</strong>: Ideal for flexible data prep. Filling and interpolation suit diverse datasets, but large files can slow down.</li>
      <li><strong>SQL</strong>: Great for database queries. COALESCE and NULLIF are fast, but you’re limited to database-stored data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Consider your dataset size, analysis goals, and tool familiarity. For the coffee shop, you might filter NULLs in Power BI for a loyalty dashboard, fill NULLs in Pandas for a sales report, or use COALESCE in SQL for a database query. Test each approach to see what keeps your data truthful.</p>

    <p>NULL values aren’t the enemy. They’re clues about your data’s gaps. Before dropping them, weigh the loss, check their meaning, and match your strategy to your goals. With Power BI, Pandas, or SQL, you can handle NULLs smartly and unlock clearer insights. What’s your dataset hiding? Start exploring today.</p>
