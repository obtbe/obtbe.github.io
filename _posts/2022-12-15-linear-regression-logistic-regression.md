    <p>Data analysis often uses two models: linear regression and logistic regression. They sound similar, but they solve different problems. This article explains their differences with clear examples to show when to use each one.</p>

    <h2>Linear Regression</h2>
    <p>Linear regression predicts numbers. It finds a straight-line relationship between inputs (independent variables) and an output (dependent variable). For example, imagine predicting a car’s gas mileage based on its weight. A heavier car might use more gas, and linear regression can model this pattern.</p>
    <p>Suppose we collect data on 50 cars, recording their weight in pounds and mileage in miles per gallon. A linear regression model might look like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Mileage = 40 - 0.01 * Weight</code></pre>
    <p>Here, 40 is the starting point (intercept), and -0.01 means that for every extra pound, mileage drops by 0.01 miles per gallon. So, a 3,000-pound car would have an estimated mileage of 40 - (0.01 * 3,000) = 10 miles per gallon. Linear regression works because the relationship is steady: weight changes predict mileage changes in a straight line.</p>

    <h2>Logistic Regression</h2>
    <p>Logistic regression predicts yes-or-no outcomes. It calculates the chance of something happening, like whether a customer will buy a product. The output is a probability between 0 and 1, which you can turn into a yes or no decision.</p>
    <p>For example, consider a store tracking 100 customers, noting their age and whether they bought a new phone. Logistic regression can predict the chance of a purchase based on age. The model might look like this:</p>
    <pre><code>Chance of Buying = 1 / (1 + e^(-(-5 + 0.1 * Age)))</code></pre>
    <p>Here, -5 and 0.1 are numbers the model learns. For a 30-year-old, the equation gives a probability, say 0.73, meaning a 73% chance of buying. If the probability is over 0.5, predict “yes”; otherwise, predict “no”. Logistic regression fits this problem because the outcome is binary: buy or don’t buy.</p>

    <h2>How They Differ</h2>
    <p>Linear and logistic regression have distinct uses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Output type</strong>: Linear regression predicts numbers, like gas mileage. Logistic regression predicts probabilities for yes-or-no questions, like buying a phone.</li>
      <li><strong>Input types</strong>: Both can use numbers or categories as inputs, but logistic regression often works with simpler inputs, like age or yes-or-no answers.</li>
      <li><strong>Math assumptions</strong>: Linear regression expects a straight-line relationship and errors that spread evenly. Logistic regression expects a relationship that curves to fit probabilities between 0 and 1.</li>
      <li><strong>Coefficient meaning</strong>: In linear regression, coefficients show how much the output changes per input unit. In logistic regression, they affect the probability curve, making them harder to interpret directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>When to Use Each</h2>
    <p>Choose the right model based on your goal. Use linear regression to predict numbers, like estimating a car’s mileage from its weight or a house’s price from its size. Use logistic regression for yes-or-no predictions, like whether a customer will buy or a student will pass a test.</p>
    <p>Can you mix them? Sometimes, but it’s tricky. Linear regression on a yes-or-no problem might give weird results, like probabilities outside 0 or 1. Logistic regression on numbers is rare because it’s built for binary outcomes. Stick to the problem type: numbers for linear, binary for logistic.</p>

    <p>Both models are powerful tools. Linear regression helps with number predictions, and logistic regression tackles binary choices. Pick the one that matches your data’s question, and you’ll get clear, useful results.</p>
