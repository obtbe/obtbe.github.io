Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by two things: numbers and nature. My grandad, who spent most of his life around horses, had a big hand in that. He’d take me out to the old family stable, where the air always smelled like hay and leather, and teach me how to ride. But it wasn’t just about sitting on a horse. He’d explain the why behind everything. Like how the angle of your body affects the horse’s movement, or how a tiny shift in weight could make all the difference. It was math, but not the kind you’d find in a textbook. It was alive, practical, and tied to the rhythm of the animal beneath you. Those moments stuck with me, and they’re a big part of why I see the world the way I do today.

These days, my work is about making sense of uncertainty. I use analysis, clear communication, and a level-headed approach to help people and businesses make better decisions. That’s what inspired me to start Quantidum, a data analytics consulting firm where we use advanced tools to solve real-world problems. It’s been a process of constant learning, and I’m still growing every day.

But for me, it’s not just about work. I’ve always believed in giving back and creating opportunities for others. That’s why I’m building MansaPi, a non-profit focused on inspiring a love for STEM in students in Mali. Through education and hands-on projects, we’re helping young people discover the beauty of science, technology, engineering, and math—and hopefully sparking a passion for solving problems.

Thank you for visiting my Blog. I hope you find both the beauty and power of data reflected in its content.
